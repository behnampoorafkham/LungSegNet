# LungSegNet

Lung segmentation is a vital task in medical image analysis that involves the extraction and delineation of lung structures from medical images such as chest X-rays or CT scans. It plays a crucial role in various clinical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computer-aided analysis. The goal of lung segmentation is to accurately separate the lung regions from the surrounding anatomical structures and background, enabling further analysis and measurements specific to lung morphology and pathology. This process typically involves the application of advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to differentiate lung tissue based on intensity, texture, shape, and spatial information. Accurate lung segmentation can significantly aid in the detection, quantification, and monitoring of lung diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), contributing to improved patient care and outcomes.

In our lung segmentation project, we utilized the powerful DeepLabV3Plus architecture, leveraging the capabilities of the ResNet50 model as the encoder. By incorporating DeepLabV3Plus, we harnessed its advanced features such as atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and decoder modules to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Our model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a remarkable Mean IoU Score of 0.9559 and an impressively low Mean Dice Loss of 0.0226. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in accurately segmenting lung structures from medical images, enabling precise identification and analysis of lung regions. By leveraging the strengths of DeepLabV3Plus and utilizing ResNet50 as the encoder, our project contributes to advancing lung segmentation methodologies and has the potential to improve various clinical applications related to pulmonary health.
